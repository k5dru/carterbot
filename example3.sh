Also mention as of December 2024, a key from Hyperbolic.xyz is free and comes with \$10 in free credits, which would take literal weeks to blow through with this program. The author of the project is James Lemley (and has no connection to any AI service provider). As this is a personal non-work project, pull requests might be responded to or ignored. Oh and please add somewhere that that OpenAI's moat, if it ever existed, is gone. Please output a new README.md now." -o README.new.md -f -m meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct
